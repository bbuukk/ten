valueOf(), toString(), and toLocaleString() exist to be polymorphic and you should expect the object to define its own implementation with sensible behaviors, so you can call them as instance methods. However, valueOf() and toString() are usually implicitly called through type conversion and you don't need to call them yourself in your code.
