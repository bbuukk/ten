# Math

The Math namespace object contains static properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions.**Math works with the Number type. It doesn't work with BigInt**

## Description

Unlike most global objects, Math is not a constructor. You cannot use it with the new operator or invoke the Atomics object as a function. All properties and methods of Math are static.

### Note: Many Math functions have a precision that's implementation-dependent

This means that different browsers can give a different result. Even the same JavaScript engine on a different OS or architecture can give different results!
