//todo recap String.prototype.localeCompare()

// The localeCompare() method of String values returns a number indicating whether this string comes before, or after, or is the same as the given string in sort order. In implementations with Intl.Collator API support, this method simply calls Intl.Collator.

// When comparing large numbers of strings, such as in sorting large arrays, it is better to create an Intl.Collator object and use the function provided by its compare() method.
